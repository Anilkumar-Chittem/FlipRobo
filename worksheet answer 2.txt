13.because a mean is easily influenced by extreme values
14.Other clustering algorithms with better features tend to be more expensive. In this case, k-means becomes a great solution for pre-clustering, reducing the space into disjoint smaller sub-spaces where other clustering algorithms can be applied.
15.The basic k-means clustering is based on a non-deterministic algorithm.The non-deterministic nature of K-Means is due to its random selection of data points as initial centroids.
