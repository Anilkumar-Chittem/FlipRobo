13.Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method of identifying and grouping similar data points in larger datasets without concern for the specific outcome.
14.K-means clustering algorithm can be significantly improved by using a better initialization technique, and by repeating (re-starting) the algorithm. When the data has overlapping clusters, k-means can improve the results of the initialization technique.

10.Bayesâ€™ theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of the conditions that might be relevant to the event.
11.z-score (also called a standard score) gives you an idea of how far from the mean a data point is.
12.A t-test is a type of inferential statistic used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups, which may be related in certain features.
13.a number where a certain percentage of scores fall below that number.
14.Analysis of variance is a collection of statistical models and their associated estimation procedures used to analyze the differences among means.
15.In other words, they help you to figure out if you need to reject the null hypothesis or accept the alternate hypothesis.
