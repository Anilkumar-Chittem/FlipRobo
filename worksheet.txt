Statistics Worksheet:
a1.True .if sucess then distribution is over one variable is p>>1  or failure 0>>1-p
a2.A-Central limit theorem
a3.B- used for unbounded count data 
a4.D
a5.C-Possion is used to count events
a6.B-no it does not change
a7.B
a8.A
a9.C-can conform  to regression
a10.Also known as gaussian distribution is a propabilty distibution that is symmetric about mean forming  a bell curve and mean at the  central peak 
a11.We need to do  eda  process  understand  what type of  data we  have,how much data is missing in the columns
    >if we have a huge missing value space in the column then we  can remove it.
    >if we have categorical missing values  then we need  to find the mode(most frequent occured element) and replace NAN with mode value
    >if we have numerical miss values  then we need  to find mean(avg of the column)  and replace NAN with mean values
a12.A/B testing is a basic randomized control experiment.
    It is a way to compare the two versions of a variable to find out which performs better in a controlled environment.
a13.No every time it is not  a good idea  to replace with mean cause it  might affect our  model performance .
    We  can use random forest to handle categorical and  numerical.
a14.Linear regression gives relationship b/w 2 variables by fitting a linear equation y=mx+c
    y is dependent and x is independent
a15.2 types 
    1.Descriptive-It organizes raw data into meaningful information
    2.inferential-It analyses sample data to draw conclusion about population

a11.A Data Warehousing is process for collecting and managing data from varied sources to provide meaningful business insights
a12.Online transaction processing (OLTP) captures, stores, and processes data from transactions in real time.
    Online analytical processing (OLAP) uses complex queries to analyze aggregated historical data from OLTP systems.
a13.Some data is denormalized for simplification and to improve performance.
    Large amounts of historical data are used.
    Queries often retrieve large amounts of data.
    Both planned and ad hoc queries are common.
    The data load is controlled
a14.Star Schema in data warehouse, in which the center of the star can have one fact table and a number of associated dimension tables.
a15.We use  set theory in maths,Set Theory as a Language SETL is a high-level programming language thatâ€™s based on the mathematical theory of sets

a13. 1) calculate the distances 2) link the clusters 3) choose a solution by selecting the right number of clusters.
a14.To measure a cluster's quality within a clustering, we can compute the average silhouette coefficient value of all objects in the cluster.
    To measure the quality of a clustering, we can use the average silhouette coefficient value of all objects in the data set. 
     Silhouette Coefficient or silhouette score is a metric used to calculate the goodness of a clustering technique. Its value ranges from -1 to 1.
a15.Cluster analysis is the task of grouping a set of data points in such a way that they can be characterized by their relevancy to one another.
    These techniques create clusters that allow us to understand how our data is related are  of 4 types
    1.Centroid Clustering-In centroid cluster analysis you choose the number of clusters that you want to classify.
      The algorithm will start by randomly selecting centroids (cluster centers) to group the data points into the two pre-defined clusters. 
      A line is then drawn separating the data points into the two clusters based on their proximity to the centroids.
       The algorithm will then reposition the centroid relative to all the points within each cluster.
     The centroids and points in a cluster will adjust through all iteratations, resulting in optimized clusters.
    2.Density Clustering-Density clustering groups data points by how densely populated they are
    3.Distribution Clustering-Distribution clustering identifies the probability that a point belongs to a cluster
    4.Connectivity Clustering- connectivity clustering initially recognizes each data point as its own cluster. 
                   The primary use of this technique is that points closer to each other are more related
